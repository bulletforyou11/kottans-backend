Actually, I am new to Git and for me it was a good stream of information. I set Git-It something to work out my skills and I will purposefully move on!

## 2. Unix Shell

I knew bash a bit, but it was usually easier for me to create directories through the interface. Very often you have to form to the resources of services or applications. And so I began to very clearly understand how convenient it is to do it through the bash, especially if you turn to the necessary files and folders.
