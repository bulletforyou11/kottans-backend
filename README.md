## 1. Git Collaboration

Actually, I am new to Git and for me it was a good stream of information. I spent more than a week on git and a very pleasant incident happened to me. I went for a technical test where basic knowledge of networks and operating networks was required. But in my tests there were questions about the geet. And this surprised me pretty much, since nothing was said about it. That's how kotan prepared my sleeping consciousness for adventure)

## 2. Unix Shell

I knew bash a bit, but it was usually easier for me to create directories through the interface. Very often you have to form to the resources of services or applications. And so I began to very clearly understand how convenient it is to do it through the bash, especially if you turn to the necessary files and folders.
